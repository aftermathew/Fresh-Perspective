Week of May 22 - 29
1) Spent sunday/monday rewriting the movie stuff to work in objective c.
2) Tuesday night tried to find examples and grok code in quicktime.
I have not grokked the fullness, but currently looking at
  - http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/QTCoreVideo101/index.html
  - http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/QTCoreVideo102/index.html

3) Reading the QTCoreVideo intro docs.  
   -http://developer.apple.com/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/CoreVideo/CVProg_Concepts/CVProg_Concepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001536-CH202-BABJDFHJ

4)  Was able to successfully in another project route the camera into an openGL animation.  This was a major step as I now have a handle on all the needed components.  However the code is all objective C and it's total GARBAGE.  Just enough changes to my own existing code and a sample application to get it to work.  This w/e I intend on taking this proof of concept code and making it a lot more stable.
